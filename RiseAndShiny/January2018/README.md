### Workshop Code Challenge

The challenge for this workshop will be to build a shiny app that can access, read and display a sheet from your personal google docs account. Basic app components should include an input textbox for specifiying the name of the sheet you want to lookup, and a datatable rendering of the data from that sheet. Extension exercises are listed on the last page of the workshop presentation. Bonus points for making your app UI look nicer than what's in the solution code!
